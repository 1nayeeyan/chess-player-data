# Chess Player Insights

## Who likes Chess the most?

The Purpose of this project is to collect, group and analyze chess.com player stats based on 

  - Country
  - Players Status (basic, premium etc.)
  - Title ( Grand Master, International Master etc.)
  - Time they joined Chess.com
  - Elo (Numerical Value measuring the player's skill)


## Motivation and Plan

I had recently heard on a video that India would be 'taking over the chess world' in the upcoming years, and I wanted to verify whether or not that could be determined through analyzing player data on Chess.com. 

Aditionally, Chess has become increasingly popular in the past few years, so I plan on creating a timeseries graph displaying the change in new users joining maybe over the past two years? I plan on using Tableau, and creating a dashboard to display this data in particular (among other things I find interesting).


The plan is to use python to get the datasets I need from the Chess.com Api and save them into csvs, possibly combining a few. Then, create a Jupyter Notebook for quick numerical analysis, and a Tableau Dashboard for visuals.

## Edit

After finding out that there are limits to requests from chess.com, this project is on hold until further assistance from chess.com developers.
